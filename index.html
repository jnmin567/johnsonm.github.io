            Hello, my name is Johnson.
            <!--1st section. Beginning of self introduction with the words being the third largest--> 
        </h3>
            <p>
                I am a Thinkful student living in the Bay Area(Livermore, California) that is learning coding to improve my skillset for employment.
                <!--First sentence of self introduction-->
            </p>
            <p>
                I look forward to completing my courses with Thinkful and use my new gained coding knowledge to work on more complicated website designs. If possible I would like to work in the tech industry where I can continue to learn and challenge myself everyday.

            <p>
                Some of my hobbies include:
                <!--Start of hobby listing-->
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hiking</li>
                <li>Weight Lifting</li>
                <li>Painting</li>

            </ul>
            <!--Lists hobbies in bullet point/unorganized list-->
            <p>
                When not coding, I like to spend my time with a good story or keeping myself active. When I have a couple of hours to spare I would paint traditional acrylic paintings or figurines. You can see a picture of the figure I painted at the top of this page.
